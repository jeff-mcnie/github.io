    <h1>Problem Solving</h1>

    <h3 class="blog-head">Stuck on a simple problem</h3>
    <p class="blog-text">
      During the gradebook repl.it I became stuck on a part of the course where I had to push a new total into an array. I was 100% sure I had the code right, I was console logging the array and I could see the item pushed into it. To try and solve this problem, I double checked my code, had a browse around the internet to see if I could find an answer, and finally asked someone for help. I had made a mistake that I had made earlier in the course where I was calling the function but running the test was also calling the function so it was doubling up my answer.<br>
      It felt.. fun. I have a lot of fun when encountering problems in coding, especially at this stage. I know the answer will be out there somewhere, I am writing fairly basic code so there will definitely be many more people who have got stuck on this. It is also a chance to ask for help and see how someone else goes about finding the problem and then solving it. In this case, Jo$eph was albe to find the fault with my code right away and explain the solution to me. I hope to have learned not to use calls when they aren't asked for.

    <h3 class="blog-head">Solved a problem elegantly</h3>
    <p class="blog-text">
      I ran into a problem during the built-in methods of the repl.it course that, I think, I solved quite elegantly. It's going to feature a problem solving technique not mentioned below. Late on tuesday afternoon, I was attempting to solve the second part of the built-in methods repl.it. The problem I was running into was that no matter what code I put in, I wasn't getting the right solution, but more importantly, I wasn't really understanding the things I was googling to help solve the problem. At first I thought I was just inaccurately googling and not getting the answers to what I wanted. Then I thought about asking for some help, but before that, I thought I would try explaining the problem to my cats. In the process of explaining what I thought should be the solution to my problem, I realized I was having a hard time explaining it and my brain was really struggling. I hadn't had much of a break that day and this was the reality check I needed to realize I needed a break. I had a break, had some food and a rest. When I returned to the code, within a few minutes I had the right solution and was able to explain the problem and solution.<br>
      I felt a bit worried during the rest period, I had a bit of self doubt creeping in, but the excellent results after the break really sold me on it. I feel like I learned the importance of having breaks and making sure I don't grind myself into a wall.
