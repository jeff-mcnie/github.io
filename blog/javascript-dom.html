      <h3 class="blog-head">Javascript, HTML, CSS and You</h3>
      <p class="blog-text">When thinking about the 3 languages, I like to think about them in relation to a human body.
        We have the HTML which is like our bones. It provides the basic structure that we have, some bones are a little different from others, but at their core, they are all still bones.
        Then there is the CSS. I like to think of the CSS as our skin and anything on the outside of it. We have different skin colors, we can change them by tanning or not going out in the sun. 
        We can also change our hair color and fingernail length just to name a few of the many changes. This is what CSS does to our page, changes the look and feel of it.
        Finally, we have the Javascript. This is our inner workings, our lungs, our heart. Javascript is the moving parts of our page, it makes things interesting and complex.
        It also interacts with the HTML and CSS like our body does. We can use the Javascript to change and add to the HTML and CSS through the DOM. Our body can do the same, the heart and liver interact with our body in different ways to change things or add to them.

      <h3 class="blog-head">Control Flow and Loops</h3>
      <p class="blog-text">I'm going to explain control flow and loops through the idea of eating dinner. Firstly we need to understand what control flow is. Control flow is the way in which your computer runs the code you have. 
        This is run from top to bottom unless there is something in the code that changes the flow. This is where our loop comes in. Our loop is going to tell our computer to keep repeating a certain set of code until a condition it has been told is met.
        So taking that into account, let's move on to dinner, and specifically a loop of eating dinner. When you eat dinner, you are effectively completing a little loop.
        The loop looks something like this:</p>
