    <h1>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</h1>

    <h3 class="blog-head">Discuss how the understanding of Neuroplasticity benefits people</h3>
    <p class="blog-text">
      When someone understands that their brain is malleable, they are more likely to succeed, grow and learn, just from the knowledge itself. 
      People who understand that their brain is capable of changing and growing are more likely to succeed than those who don’t.
    </p>

    <h3 class="blog-head">Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit.</h3>
    <p class="blog-text">
      I am going to keep in mind and use 2 principles of neuroplasticity to aid in my study. The two are repetition and use it or lose it. 
      These will be a good reminder to engage in study everyday and keep the things I am studying relevant to the future goals I want to achieve.
    </p>

    <h3 class="blog-head">What are some ways to increase your Neuroplasticity</h3>
    <p class="blog-text">
      You can increase neuroplasticity by challenging the brain. Tasks like learning a new instrument or completing crosswords and sudokus are good for this.
       It also seems to be that in general, if you give your brain a lot of challenging variety it will improve your neuroplasticity.

    <h3 class="blog-head">What is growth mindset and why is it relevant</h3>
    <p class="blog-text">
      Growth mindset is the mindset where you believe you can get smarter and are open to new challenges. 
      Someone with a growth mindset will be more open to attempting difficult problems, sticking with hard challenges when they don’t immediately get the answer right and will achieve greater success over time. 
      This is relevant to me because a growth mindset will help me achieve on this course and in the workplace or life in general. 
      We are going to be faced with a number of very hard problems during this course and if I am able to keep a growth mindset, I will achieve far greater success in the long run.
    </p>

    <h3 class="blog-head">In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h3>
    <p class="blog-text">
      Nothing really surprised or changed for me.
      I did this part of the course during the pre-course work so I had watched all this before and was already thinking along these lines.
      I was surprised to learn I must’ve deleted my notes on the subject though :(
    </p>

    <h3 class="blog-head">How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h3>
    <p class="blog-text">
      I am going to integrate growth mindset into my learning journey by reminding myself during my meditation each day that I can get smarter and I can achieve difficult tasks. 
      I think combining these two things together seems like a good way for me to achieve good results.

    <h3 class="blog-head">Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.</h3>
    <p class="blog-text">
      By keeping a growth mindset in mind, I might be able to ward of the negative self-doubting voice in my head sometimes by reminding myself that I can grow and I will get better. Knowing that my brain is malleable and capable of changing will also help me with being patient with myself when learning new things. 
      If I am able to keep on top of my thoughts and remain in a positive growth mindset I will be able overcome any difficulties in my way.
